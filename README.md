**Overview**
This project requires you to select or create a dataset, analyse it using descriptive 
statistics, apply one basic machone learning tecnique, and present your findings in  
both a written report & and published website using GitHub Pages.

--------------------------PROJECT TO-DO LIST---------------------------

1️⃣ Dataset & Excel Work        
☐ Create an Excel file  
☐ Put the raw dataset inside     
☐ Calculate descriptive statistics:       
Mean    
Median    
Mode
Minimum    
Maximum    
Standard Deviation    
Any other useful stats    
If data is categorical → list categories and counts    
☐ Check for missing values     
Count how many missing values per column    
☐ Create at least 3 meaningful charts    
Charts must relate clearly to the data    
Make sure they help explain patterns or trends

2️⃣ Write the Report (1000 words)    
☐ Dataset overview    
What is the dataset about?    
Where did it come from?    
What variables are included?    

☐ Data cleaning summary    
What problems were found?    
How were missing values handled?    
Any changes made?     

☐ Explain descriptive statistics     
What do the numbers mean?      
Any interesting patterns?      

☐ Visual analysis     
Explain what each graph shows     
What insights do we learn from them?     

☐ Basic Machine Learning section     
Choose:     
☐ Regression (predict a number using Linear Regression)      
OR      
☐ Classification (predict a category using Logistic Regression)      
Explain:     
What you predicted     
What features (variables) you used     
How well the model performed      

☐ Include full AI chat (link or PDF screenshot)      

☐ Limitations & ethics      
What are the weaknesses of the dataset?      
Any bias or ethical concerns?      

☐ Conclusion      
Final findings      
What did you learn?      

3️⃣ Website + GitHub Pages (check brightspace Keith Nolan instrcutions)       
☐ Create a simple website using:      
HTML
Bootstrap (for layout/design)      
Chart.js (for charts)       
☐ Put charts on the website      
☐ Deploy website using GitHub Pages     

4️⃣ Group Recorded Presentation       
☐ Create Microsoft Teams group call      
☐ Record the presentation       
☐ Every member must speak      
☐ Each person explains:       
What they worked on       
Key findings
